# Cab-Service (Ruby On Rails)
Modelling Problem
In this project we need to build a taxi service with the flollowing scenarios:

·  You have a fleet of cabs at your disposal, and each cab has a location, determined by it’s latitude and longitude.
·  A customer can call one of your taxis by providing their location, and you must assign the nearest taxi to the customer.
·  Some customers are particular that they only ride around in pink cars, for hipster reasons. You must support this ability.
·  When the cab is assigned to the customer, it can no longer pick up any other customers
·  If there are no taxis available, you reject the customers request.
·  The customer ends the ride at some location. The cab waits around outside the customer’s house, and is available to be assigned to another customer.
·  Unfortunately, you skipped Geography, and believe the earth is flat. The distance between two points can be calculated by Pythagoras’ theorem
